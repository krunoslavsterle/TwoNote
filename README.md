# TwoNote

This is a simple note-taking application I have created to get familiar with the ASP.NET Core 2 framework. The idea for the application came from the [Microsoft One Note](https://www.onenote.com) app. 

## Built With
* ASP.NET Core 2 (MVC)
* Entity Framework Core 2.0
* ASP.NET Core Identity 2.0

## Architecture
Simplified [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture)
